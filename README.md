# Introduction
This is a part of my senior project which is research of Analysis and Performance Evaluation of Expresswayâ€™s Pay Toll System 

The objective is to do image processing for video traffic to extract the average inter-arrival time of vehicle for each lane. In other word, it is a time-lapse between incoming vehicles. Another example is distribution of inter-arrival time of vehicle.

The main code is "dindaeng.m" which goes through processes as image below
